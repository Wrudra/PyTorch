# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks  

Exploring frameworks and libraries of machine learning and deep learning for my courses (**CSE 465: Pattern Recognition and Neural Network, CSE 445: Machine Learning**). My focus includes:

- **PyTorch** – Implementing flexible and dynamic neural networks
- **Scikit-learn** – Essential for traditional machine learning models
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical computations
